		Consider the following interface definition. What's wrong with it?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsRepository</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Create</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;Reservation?&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservation</span>(Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Update</span>(Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps you think that the name is incorrect; that this really isn't an example of the Repository design pattern, as it's described in <a href="http://bit.ly/patternsofeaa">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>. Ironically, of all patterns, it may be the one most affected by <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html">semantic diffusion</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's not what I have in mind, though. There's something else with that interface.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's not its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> design, either. You could consider that a leaky abstraction, since it strongly implies a sort of persistent data store. That's a worthwhile discussion, but not what I have in mind today. There's something else wrong with the interface.
	</p>

		Consistency <a href="#998668fec2d9488db5a31a99c0c81774" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Look closer at the parameters for the various methods. The <code>Create</code> and <code>ReadReservations</code> methods take a <code>restaurantId</code> parameter, but the other three don't.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why does the <code>ReadReservations</code> method take a <code>restaurantId</code> while <code>ReadReservation</code> doesn't? Why is that parameter required for <code>Create</code>, but not for <code>Update</code>? That doesn't seem consistent.
	</p>
	<p>
		The reason is that each reservation has an ID (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">GUID</a>). Once the reservation exists, you can uniquely identify it to read, update, or delete it.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter suggests, however, this interface is part of a multi-tenant code base. This code base implements an online restaurant reservation system as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> API. It's an online service where each restaurant is a separate tenant.
	</p>
	<p>
		While each reservation has a unique ID, the system still needs to associate it with a restaurant. Thus, the <code>Create</code> method must take a <code>restaurantId</code> parameter in order to associate the reservation with a restaurant.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the reservation is stored, however, it's possible to uniquely identify it with the ID. The <code>ReadReservation</code>, <code>Update</code>, and <code>Delete</code> methods need only the <code>id</code> to work.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand, when you're <em>not</em> querying on reservation ID, you'll need to identify the restaurant, as with the <code>ReadReservations</code> methods. If you didn't identify the restaurant in that method, you'd get all reservations in the requested range, from all tenants. That's not what you want. Therefore, you must supply the <code>restaurantId</code> to limit the query.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interface is inconsistent, but also allows the underlying implementation to leak through.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		If I told you that the implementation of <code>IReservationsRepository</code> is based on a relational database, can you imagine the design? You may want to stop reading and see if you can predict what the database looks like.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interface strongly implies a design like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">CREATE</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">TABLE</span>&nbsp;[dbo]<span style="color:gray;">.</span>[Reservations]<span style="color:blue;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color:gray;">(</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Email]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">NVARCHAR&nbsp;</span><span style="color:gray;">(</span>50<span style="color:gray;">)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NOT</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Quantity]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">INT</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NOT</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[PublicId]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">UNIQUEIDENTIFIER</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NOT</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RestaurantId]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">INT</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NOT</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:gray;">NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">PRIMARY</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">KEY</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">CLUSTERED&nbsp;</span><span style="color:gray;">(</span>[Id]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">ASC</span><span style="color:gray;">),</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">CONSTRAINT</span>&nbsp;[AK_PublicId]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">UNIQUE</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">NONCLUSTERED&nbsp;</span><span style="color:gray;">(</span>[PublicId]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">ASC</span><span style="color:gray;">)</span>
<span style="color:gray;">);</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		What I wrote above is even clearer now. You can't create a row in that table without supplying a <code>RestaurantId</code>, since that column has a <code>NOT NULL</code> constraint.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>PublicId</code> column has a <code>UNIQUE</code> constraint, which means that you can uniquely read and manipulate a single row when you have an ID.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since all reservations are in a single table, any query <em>not</em> based on <code>PublicId</code> should also filter on <code>RestaurantId</code>. If it doesn't, the result set could include reservations from all restaurants.
	</p>
	<h3 id="646f0fb2adf147c6bca42d9aada6cf43">
		Other interpretations <a href="#646f0fb2adf147c6bca42d9aada6cf43" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Is the above relational database design the only possible implementation? Perhaps not. You could implement the interface based on a document database as well. It'd be natural to store each reservation as a separate document with a unique ID. Again, once you have the ID, you can directly retrieve and manipulate the document.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other implementations become harder, though. Imagine, for example, that you want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)">shard</a> the database design: Each restaurant gets a separate database. Or perhaps, more realistically, you distribute tenants over a handful of databases, perhaps partitioned on physical location, or some other criterion.
	</p>
	<p>
		With such a design, the <code>ReadReservation</code>, <code>Update</code>, and <code>Delete</code> methods become more inefficient. While you should be able to identify the correct shard if you have a restaurant ID, <em>you don't have that information.</em> Instead, you'll have to attempt the operation on all databases, thereby eliminating most  sharding benefits.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other words, the <em>absence</em> of the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter from some of the methods suggests certain implementation details.
	</p>
	<h3 id="5edc25ddf2c8439096577e8eaf45806c">
		Leak by omission <a href="#5edc25ddf2c8439096577e8eaf45806c" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I admit that I rarely run into this sort of problem. Usually, a leaky abstraction manifests by a language construct that contains <em>too much</em> information. This is typically an interface or base class that exposes implementation details by either requiring too specific inputs, or by returning data that reveals implementation details.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a data access abstraction like the above 'repository', this most frequently happens when people design such an interface around an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">object-relational mapper</a> (ORM). A class like <code>Reservation</code> would then typically carry ORM details around. Perhaps it inherits from an ORM base class, or perhaps (this is very common) it has a parameterless constructor or getters and setters that model the relationships of the database (these are often called <em>navigation properties</em>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Another common examples of a leaky abstraction might be the presence of <code>Connect</code> and <code>Disconnect</code> methods. The <code>Connect</code> method may even take a <code>connectionString</code> parameter, clearly leaking that some sort of database is involved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yet another example is <a href="/2014/08/11/cqs-versus-server-generated-ids">CQS-violating designs where a <code>Create</code> method returns a database ID</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		All such leaky abstractions are leaky because they expose or require too much information.
	</p>
	<p>
		The example in this article, on the contrary, is leaky because of a lack of detail.

		Dependency Inversion Principle <a href="#d6391eb7487d4b3ca38e4e5b1e868bd5" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Ironically, I originally arrived at the above design because I followed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</a> (DIP). The clients of <code>IReservationsRepository</code> are ASP.NET Controller actions, like this <code>Delete</code> method:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[HttpDelete(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;restaurants/{restaurantId}/reservations/{id}&quot;</span>)]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">async</span>&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">string</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(Guid.TryParse(id,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">out</span>&nbsp;var&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">rid</span>))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">r</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;Repository.ReadReservation(rid)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;Repository.Delete(rid).ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(r&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">is</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">await</span>&nbsp;PostOffice.EmailReservationDeleted(restaurantId,&nbsp;r)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ConfigureAwait(<span style="color:blue;">false</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		As Robert C. Martin explains about the Dependency Inversion Principle:
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				"clients [...] own the abstract interfaces"
			</p>
			<footer><cite>Robert C. Martin, <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">APPP</a>, chapter 11</cite></footer>
		</blockquote>
		From that principle, it follows that the <code>Delete</code> method decides what <code>IReservationsRepository.Delete</code> looks like. It seems that the Controller action doesn't <em>need</em> to tell the <code>Repository</code> about the <code>restaurantId</code> when calling its <code>Delete</code> method. Supplying the reservation ID (<code>rid</code>) is enough.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are, however, various problems with the above code. If the DIP suggests that the <code>restaurantId</code> is redundant when calling <code>Repository.Delete</code>, then why is it required when calling <code>PostOffice.EmailReservationDeleted</code>? This seems inconsistent.
	</p>
	<p>
		Indeed it is.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I often do, I arrived at the above <code>Delete</code> method via <a href="/outside-in-tdd">outside-in TDD</a>, but as I observed a decade ago, <a href="/2010/12/22/TheTDDApostate">TDD alone doesn't guarantee good design</a>. Even when following the <a href="/2019/10/21/a-red-green-refactor-checklist">red-green-refactor checklist</a>, I often fail to spot problems right away.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's okay. TDD doesn't guarantee perfection, but done well it should set you up so that you can easily make changes.
	</p>
	<h3 id="b19d4f16b2ee48759c0e4d698a83cfdc">
		Possible remedies <a href="#b19d4f16b2ee48759c0e4d698a83cfdc" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I can think of two ways to address the problem. The simplest solution is to make the interface consistent by adding a <code>restaurantId</code> parameter to all methods:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsRepository</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Create</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;Reservation?&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservation</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Update</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the simplest solution, and the one that I prefer. In a future article, I'll show how it enabled me to significantly simplify the code base.
	</p>
	<p>
		For good measure, though, I should also mention the opposite solution. Completely drain the interface of <code>restaurantId</code> parameters:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsRepository</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Create</span>(Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;Reservation?&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservation</span>(Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Update</span>(Reservation&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">reservation</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Delete</span>(Guid&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">id</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		How can that work in practice? After all, an implementation <em>must</em> have a restaurant ID in order to create a new row in the database.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's possible to solve that problem by making the <code>restaurantId</code> an implementation detail. You could make it a constructor parameter for the concrete class, but this gives you another problem. Your <a href="/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot">Composition Root</a> doesn't know the restaurant ID - after all, it's a run-time argument.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a method like the above <code>Delete</code> Controller action, you'd have to translate the <code>restaurantId</code> run-time argument to an <code>IReservationsRepository</code> instance. There are various ways around that kind of problem, but they typically involve some kind of <em>factory</em>. That'd be yet another interface:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsRepositoryFactory</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IReservationsRepository&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Create</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That just makes the API more complicated. Factories give <a href="/dippp">Dependency Injection</a> a bad reputation. For that reason, I don't like this second alternative.
	</p>
	<h3 id="ae975d7eff014d31b26ec78fa055f343">
		Conclusion <a href="#ae975d7eff014d31b26ec78fa055f343" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Leaky abstractions usually express themselves as APIs that expose too many details; the implementation details leak through.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example, however, a leaky abstraction manifested as a lack of consistency. Some methods require a <code>restaurantId</code> argument, while others don't - because one particular implementation doesn't need that information.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turned out, though, that when I was trying to simplify the overall code, this API design held me back. Consistently adding <code>restaurantId</code> parameters to all repository methods solved the problem. A future article tells that tale.

				Tobias, thank you for writing. You raise a good point, and it might be an appropriate way to model the problem. While the thought had already crossed my mind, I must admit that I hadn't given it much thought.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the individual CRUD operations, I admit that it might be an appropriate design option. You do, however, also point to the <code>ReadReservations</code> method as the odd man out. I applaud the intellectual honesty you exhibit by bring this up yourself, and I don't intend to misuse it by shooting down your idea. The fact that this method is somehow different might be an indication that it doesn't belong as a member of the same interface as the other four methods.
			</p>
			<p>
				If that's the case, though, then where does it belong? One option would be to <a href="/2014/03/10/solid-the-next-step-is-functional">define all interfaces with only a single method</a>:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReservationsDateRangeQuery</span>
{ 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">restaurantId</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);
}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				How should we deal with the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter in such an interface? Should it be included, as is the case here, or should we exclude it from the interface definition, like the following?
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>
Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Reservation&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">ReadReservations</span>(DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">min</span>,&nbsp;DateTime&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">max</span>);</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				If we choose to exclude the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter from the interface, it'd be consistent with the CRUD interface that you imply. On the other hand, wouldn't it require some sort of factory, as <a href="#b19d4f16b2ee48759c0e4d698a83cfdc">I outlined above</a>?
			</p>
			<p>
				Conversely, if we decide to keep the <code>restaurantId</code> parameter as part of the interface definition, it seems inconsistent with the design your suggestion implies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm not writing this to shoot down your suggestion. I find it a real conundrum.

				I do think, though, that this might be an indication that there's some kind of abstraction that I've failed to make explicit. Some kind of <em>Restaurant</em> or <em>Tenant</em> type seems most likely.
			</p>
			<p>
				My problem is that I actually do have a <code>Restaurant</code> class in my code base. That one, however, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object">Value Object</a>, so I'm loath to add impure methods to it.

				For what it's worth, it's deliberation like this that makes software design interesting. You need to balance opposing forces. A good design is one that does so in a stable way. I'm not claiming that the code shown here does that. You've clearly put your finger on a sore spot, which suggests to me that there's more work to be done. Thank you for the inspiring input!

		<p>Thank you for the well-thought out response, Mark! </p>

		<p>I completely agree that problems and discussions like these are what makes software design interesting. Indeed, more often than not it&#39;s a balancing act, more than it is a pursuit of the perfect solution.</p>

		<p>I was also thinking something along the lines of a Restaurant type that could act as an aggregate root. Then ReadReservations could be moved as a member to this type. </p>

		<p>Another approach could be examining the usage of the method. I don&#39;t know what the purpose of the ReadReservations method is, but it <em>looks</em> like a method that&#39;s used to query data for presentation to the user of the application. Perhaps this suggests a need for a separate read and write model? No doubt this would introduce more complexity to the application, but I guess that&#39;s where the balancing act comes into play again. :-)</p>
